# Pixel Art Editor - Advanced

This project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for teaching purposes. It is a very basic Pixel Art Editor, where you can select the number of pixels, the size of the pixels, the color to set in the pixel, and add new colors.

Obs.: It is called "Advanced" because there is o more simplistic version of it.
